## Cypress plugin API

Cypress plugin for effective API testing. Imagine Postman, but in Cypress.

### Installation

Install this package:
```bash
npm i cypress-plugin-api

// or

yarn add cypress-plugin-api
```

Import the plugin into your `cypress/support/e2e.js` file:
```js
import 'cypress-plugin-api'
// or
require('cypress-plugin-api')
```

### Usage
You can now use `cy.api()` command. This command works exactly like `cy.request()` but in addition to calling your API, it will print our information about the API call in your Cypress runner.

### Features
- view responses in UI frame as well as in the timeline
- showing query objects, headers, request body and response
- color coding of methods
- copy response to clipboard (works for last test only)
- snapshots
